    "Omega-3 fatty acids has been known to have beneficial effects on human health, due to their anti-inflammatory, antithrombotic and antiarrhythmic properties [1]. Fatty acids have a carboxyl group in one end and a methyl group in the other end, where the carboxyl group is the reactive group. Fatty acids that contain a double bond in the hydrocarbon chain is known as an unsaturated fatty acid. If it contains more than one double, it is known as a polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA). Omega-3 fatty acids are PUFA and they are named this way due to the fact that the first double bond is located on carbon number 3 [2]. Among the omega-3 fatty acids eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) has shown to have beneficial properties. EPA can be found in algae and fatty fish such as tuna and salmon [1]. EPA consist of 20 carbons and 5 double bonds. The human body cannot naturally synthesize these fatty acids, therefore we need to get them through our diet [2]. Studies have also shown that EPA have a critical role in fetal retina and brain development, which is why pregnant women are advised to eat food with omega-3 fatty acids in their diet, since the developing fetus’ only source of fatty acids is coming from the mother via the placenta [3]. However, pregnant woman has to be careful when eating fatty fish in order to get EPA, since the presence of methyl mercury (MeHg) in fish can be harmful to the fetus [4]. Since EPA have these beneficial properties, it could therefore be advantageous to find other ways for people to intake these fatty acids beside eating fatty fish. Vegans do not eat fish, so they would also lack EPA in their diet. Supplements in the form of fish oil pills exist, however these pills are produced from the remains of fish in aquaculture [5], which vegans would still be unable to consume. Therefore, a way to produce EPA without the use of fish, but having cells produce the PUFA would be beneficial. Underneath is figure 1, showcasing the heterologous pathway we have to insert into our model to produce EPA. The pathway consist of omega-6 fatty acids such as linoleic acid (LA), Eicosadieonic acid (EDA), Dihomo-G-linoleic acid (DGLA) and arachidonic acid (ARA) which are precursors to EPA. The enzymes needed to synthesize the omega-6 fatty into EPA are Δ9-elongase (LA to EDA), Δ8-desaturase (EDA to DGLA), Δ5-desaturase (DGLA to ARA) and Δ17-desaturase (ARA to EPA) [6]."

    "### 1.2 Literature review of the cell factory (<500 words)\n",
    "The cell factory chosen for this project, is the ascomycete yeast *Yarrowia lipolytica*, that is a certified GRAS (generally recognized as safe) organism [7].  It is a versatile organism capable of utilizing a wide array of carbon substrates [8], and simultaneously also has a diverse portfolio of products from weak acids and proteins to biofuels and lipids. In general, the products of interest are derived from the yeasts’ ability to secrete enzymes / proteins and accumulate high amounts of lipid [9]. \n",
    "\t\t\t\n",
    "For the lasts 50 years, extensive work has been done to genetically engineer *Y. lipolytica* and several engineering strategies have been established such as CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing, DNA assembly methods, replicative vectors etc. Amongst these are 3 in silico models that will be mentioned later [10]. To this end, various strains are now being developed to support the engineering strategies, leading to specialized cell factories.\n",
    "\n",
    "The yeast however also has its drawbacks, as there exist several challenges for *Y. lipolytica* as a cell factory at an industrial level. The most immediate of them is the growth rate, which generally is low for oleaginous yeasts, resulting in lower yields of the desired products. However, the extensive research into *Y. lipolytica* can help improve growth rates and production yield for the specific product [11]. \n",
    "\n",
    "For this project *Y. lipolytica* was chosen to produce the omega-3 fatty acids, EPA and DHA. As mentioned, the yeast at its core is an outstanding producer of lipids and already has a strong base for genetic engineering, with in silico models at the ready. \n",
    "Other considerations for the cell factory of choice, include another oleaginous yeast named *Trichosporon oleaginosus*, which can utilize aromatic based feedstock as substrate, while accumulating up to 70% of its biomass as lipids [12]. Even though this is highly interesting to the project, the industrial applications and genetic engineering strategies are not on the same level compared to *Y. lipolytica*. \n",
    "\n",
    "Another contender is probably the most well researched yeast, *Saccharomyces cerevisiae*. The yeast is well known as a reliable cell factory with robust genetic tools and high relevance in the industry. Several papers have been written on the accumulation of fatty acid production from the yeast [12]. However, for this paper, *Y. lipolytica* is of higher interest, as the initial high accumulation of lipids pave the way for a theoretically higher yield than S. cerevisiae would provide, though it might be easier to practically engineer.

    "## 2. Problem definition (<300 words)\n",
    "\n",
    "The main contributors of omega-3 fatty acids, more specifically EPA, in a normal diet are naturally fatty sea food products [13]. They can also be obtained through dietary supplements, which are either directly extracted from algae, or from fish [14]. One of the disadvantages of extracting the fatty acids from fish, is that it limits who can use these supplements, as vegans and vegetarians will not use them. Another disadvantage is that it is tedious to both farm the fish, and extract the oils from them [15]. The problem with algae bioreactors is that they are more challenging than other types of bioreactors, and require more space for the same volume. That is because in order for the algae to grow, they need sunlight for photosynthesis, which cannot penetrate very deep into the reactor, resulting in a reactor design with a larger surface area, and not very efficient in terms of volume [16].\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to solve these problems the omega-3 fatty acids could be produced by heterogeneous expression in *Y. lipolytica*. By using a yeast such as *Y. lipolytica*, both the disadvantages from production in fish, and in algae are circumvented. It is both easier and less strenuous on the environment than production in fish, and there would be none of the dietary restrictions as mentioned before. It would also be more space efficient than production in algae."
