# 27410 - Group assignment - Group 10 - Eicosapentaenoic Acid (EPA) production in Yarrowia Lipolytica

> Dear students, thank you for accepting the group assignment. Please fill in the

> Please also replace `[PUT-YOUR-REPOSITORY-HERE]` up in the first line ðŸ‘† with the name of your repository here on GitHub.
> That way someone can click on the Binder badge icon and open your project in Jupyter lab to explore it.
> For this to work you will also have to keep `requirements.txt` up to date (by running `pip freeze > requirements.txt`).
> Furthermore, this will only work if you decide to make your repository public (which you can do under Settings -> Options),
> which I would encourage you to do â€“ up to you. A lot of good science happens out in the open these days.
> Good luck!

## Project summary (<300 words)
The aim of the project has been to edit a model of *Yarrowia lipolytica*, for it to produce Eicosapentaenoic Acid (EPA). The organism was chosen due to its natural capability of producing fatty acids and having a native pathway, producing some precursors of EPA. 

We encountered alot of problems concerning the models for *Y. lipolytica*, also accounted for in the report, and therefore opted to switch to the scaffold model that these *Y. lipolytica* models are based on. The model we ended up using (iND750) is a *Saccharomyces cerevisiae* model, and we therefore inserted a few extra steps in the pathway for it to produce EPA. From this model we showed that production of EPA is possible in *S. cerevisiae*, and with a better working *Y. lipolytica* model we would probably have acchieved similar results (hopefully with better yields).

## Project overview
The project is organized as follows:

Main report is found in "Report.md"
Memote reports of models not used in the final analysis are found in folder "Memote_reports"
Model work of models not used in the final analysis are found in folder "Model_reload"
The model iND750, memote report for this model, and all analysis done using this model are found in folder "Analysis"
All figures shown in the report plus some additional ones are found in folder "Figures"
